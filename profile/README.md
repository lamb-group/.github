# Laboratory for Accelerated Materials Breakthroughs (LAMB)
AKA Lam Research Group @ UMass Lowell

Accelerating materials innovation for extreme environments and clean energy systems.


## 🧭 About Us
The **Laboratory for Accelerated Materials Breakthroughs (LAMB)** is a multidisciplinary research group focused on advancing the discovery, understanding, and deployment of materials that operate under extreme conditions. Our work spans molten salts, radiation-tolerant ceramics, high-temperature systems, and novel material design approaches for clean energy technologies.

We combine:

- ⚛️ **Atomistic and multiscale modeling** (DFT, MD, AIMD, MLMD)
- 📊 **Machine learning and data-driven methods**
- 🔍 **Spectroscopic analysis** (e.g., XAS)
- 🔄 **Computational–experimental integration**
